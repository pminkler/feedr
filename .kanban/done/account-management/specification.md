# Account Management Feature

## Overview
Implement comprehensive account management functionality to give users control over their accounts.

## Goals
1. Allow users to sign out from their accounts
2. Enable users to delete their accounts and associated data

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Sign Out Functionality
- [ ] Create or update a sign-out button in the user interface
- [ ] Implement sign-out logic using AWS Amplify Auth
- [ ] Clear local storage/cookies after sign-out
- [ ] Redirect users to the appropriate page post-sign-out
- [ ] Add appropriate success/error notifications
- [ ] Ensure i18n support for all user-facing text

### Phase 2: Account Deletion
- [ ] Design account deletion UI/UX flow
- [ ] Create confirmation modal with clear warnings about data loss
- [ ] Implement backend functionality to:
  - [ ] Delete user's recipes and related data
  - [ ] Delete user's meal plans
  - [ ] Remove user from any shared resources
  - [ ] Delete the user's authentication record
- [ ] Implement frontend deletion process
- [ ] Add appropriate success/error notifications
- [ ] Ensure i18n support for all user-facing text

## Technical Considerations
- Use AWS Amplify Auth for identity management
- Follow existing UI patterns from the dashboard-example
- Maintain strong typing throughout implementation
- Ensure all async operations have proper error handling
- Update relevant composables (particularly useAuth.ts)

## Security Considerations
- Require confirmation for destructive actions
- Implement proper authentication checks before processing deletion
- Ensure complete data removal for GDPR compliance
- Log account deletion events for audit purposes

## Testing Criteria
- Verify sign-out works across different browsers
- Confirm all user data is properly deleted
- Test account deletion flow under various scenarios
- Verify proper error handling for edge cases
